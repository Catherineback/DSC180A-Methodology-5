# Quarter 2 Project Brainstorming
**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter would be mitigating bias using AIF360 in certain datasets such as the medical expediture data.
I found this interesting because it shows how we as data scientists have control over mitigating bias in models that make big desicisions in peoples health
and lives.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is into a government dataset and mitigate bias. I want to explore 
a machine learning model that has already been created by other researchers, find the bias in that, and try to mitigate the bias with our
own dataset to predict the same outcome. For example there is a california dataset on jurisdictions from hate crime offenders. I would like to 
find a model that predicts the juristiction, find bias, then create my own model mitigating that bias. 

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project would be to have more freedom within the replication
project. I think I would also like to have a class dedicated to going over using one technique in the AIF360 library and showing how it can be
used outside of the replication project.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

One potential technique I would be interested in using in my project would be to use AIF360 in creating my model to mitigate the bias. I would use preprocessing and postprocessing techniques.
